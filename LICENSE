The logo and the brand name “webpack” are not part of the MIT license, and can only be used commercially by the webpack project on products, websites, and publications.

Under the following conditions, third parties may use the webpack logo as well:

- The logo can only be used to point to the product webpack. When used with a link on a web page, it should point to the URL https://webpack.js.org/.
- You will visualize and promote your own branding more prominent than you use the webpack logo. The webpack logo only can be used as a secondary brand, which means it has to be clear for an average viewer that this is not an official webpack website, publication or product.
- You can use the webpack logo on promotion products, such as T-shirts or caps or trade show booths, provided it is a secondary brand as described in point 2.
- The logo is used unaltered, without fancy enhancements, in original colors, original typography, and always complete (logo + text webpack).
- In case you use the logo on products you sell commercially, you always have to contact us with a picture of how it will be used, and ask for explicit permission.

If you have further questions or doubts, do not hesitate to contact us. You can create an issue at https://github.com/webpack/media or write an email to mail@johannesewald.de
