# media

Contains artwork, designs and images related to the webpack project.

## Name

webpack should always be written in lower-case letters. Even at the beginning of a sentence.

## Logo

The webpack logo should be placed on a white background with enough space around it like this:

![logo white example](/logo/logo-on-white-bg.png?raw=true)

[svg](/logo/logo-on-white-bg.svg) | [png](/logo/logo-on-white-bg.png) | [jpg](/logo/logo-on-white-bg.jpg)

Just double the size of the blue cube to get an idea how much space the logo should have.

For dark backgrounds, you can use the negative version of the logo:

![logo dark example](/logo/logo-on-dark-bg.jpg?raw=true)

[svg](/logo/logo-on-dark-bg.svg) | [png](/logo/logo-on-dark-bg.png) | [jpg](/logo/logo-on-dark-bg.jpg)

## Icons

In situations where only square-sized pictures are allowed (like avatars), you may also use the big icon:

<img src="/logo/icon-big.png?raw=true" width="250" alt="icon big example">

[png](/logo/icon-big.png.png)

When only small pictures are allowed (like favicons), you can choose the smaller icon:

<img src="/logo/icon-small.png?raw=true" width="50" alt="icon small example">

[png](/logo/icon-small.png.png)

*The icon is designed to be used in space-constrained areas. If possible, please prefer icon + text.*

## Font

## License

We still need to choose a proper license for this (see [#1](https://github.com/webpack/media/issues/1)). Until then, it is not permitted to use anything here outside the webpack project.
